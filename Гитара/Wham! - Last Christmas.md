D
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
         Bm                Bm7
But the very next day you gave it away
 Em
This year to save me from tears
       A                  A7
I'll give it to someone special.

 D
Once bitten and twice shy
 Bm                         Bm7
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
 Em
Tell me baby do you recognise me?
       A                    A7
Well it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me.

 D
I wrapped it up and sent it
         Bm                      Bm7
With a note saying "I Love You" I meant it
 Em
Now I know what a fool I've been
             A                          A7
But if you kissed me now I know you'd fool me again

 D
A crowded room, friends with tired eyes, I'm hiding
       Bm           Bm7
from you and your soul of ice
 Em
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
             A               A7
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

 D
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
   Bm                      Bm7
A man undercover but you tore me apart
 Em
Oooh Oooh
             A                       A7
Now I've found a real love you'll never fool me again.
