[Intro]
A

[Verse 1]
      D    G    Bm
Come along with me
     D      A        G
To a town beside the sea
       Bm                 G
We can wander through the forest
    D           A
And do so as we please
 
[Verse 2]
     D     G    Bm
Come along with me
     D       A     G
To a cliff under a tree
			Bm             G
Where we'll gaze upon the water
      G   A       D
As an everlasting dream
 
[Chorus]
F#7         G
All of my affections
   A                       D
I give them all to you
F#7                     G
Maybe by next summer
   D            A
We won't have changed our tune
 
[Verse 3]
        D    G  Bm
We'll still want to be
     D       A        G
In this town beside the sea
D             G
Making up new numbers
    G         A    D
And living so merrily
 
[Chorus]
F#7           G
All of my affections
            A      D
I give them all to you
     F#7             G
I'll be here for you always
    E7            A
And always be for you
 
[Verse 4]
      D    G    Bm
Come along with me
     D      A        G
To a town beside the sea
       D                  G
We can wander through the forest
    D     A     Bm
And do so as we please
G         A    D
Living so merrily
