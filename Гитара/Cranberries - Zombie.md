Verse:
Em       C               G                D/F# 
Another head hangs lowly child is slowly taken 
Em               C                   G               D/F# 
And the violence caused such silence who are we mistaken 
        Em                        C 
But you see it's not me, it's not my family,  
        G                               D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they are fighting 
           Em                              C  
With their tanks, and their bombs, and their bombs, and their guns
         G              D/F# 
in your head, the are crying. 

Chorus:
        Em            C            G           D/F# 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Em            C            G         D/F# 
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 

Verse:
Em        C                  G              D/F# 
Anothers mother's breaking, heart is taking over. 
Em                C               G            D/F# 
When the violence caused silence, we must be mistaken. 
         Em                   C  
It's the same old theme since nineteen sixteen, 
        G                                  D/F# 
in your head, in your head, they're still fighting 
           Em                              C  
With their tanks, and their bombs, and their bombs, and their guns
        G                            D/F# 
In your head, in your head, they're dying. 

Chorus:
        Em            C            G         D/F# 
In your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie 
               Em            C            G       D/F# 
What's in your head, in your head, zombie, zombie, zombie.
