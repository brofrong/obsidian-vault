# Imagine Dragons - Demons

```chords
Capo 3rd

       C
When the days are cold
       G
And the cards all fold
       Am
And the saints we see
       F
Are all made of gold

       C
When your dreams all fail
       G
And the ones we hail
       Am
Are the worst of all
       F
And the blood's run stale

       C
I want to hide the truth
       G
I want to shelter you
       Am
But with the beast inside
       F
There's nowhere we can hide

       C
No matter what we breed
       G
We still are made of greed
       Am
This is my kingdom come
       F
This is my kingdom come

       C
When you feel my heat
       G
Look into my eyes
       Am
It's where my demons hide
       F
It's where my demons hide
       C
Don't get to close
       G
It's dark inside
       Am
It's where my demons hide
       F
It's where my demons hide

       C
When the curtain's call
       G
Is the last of all
       Am
When the lights fade out
       F
All the sinners crawl

       C
So they dug your grave
       G
And the masquerade
       Am
Will come calling out
       F
At the mess you made

       C
Don't want to let you down
       G
But I am hell bound
       Am
Though this is all for you
       F
Don't want to hide the truth

       C
No matter what we breed
       G
We still are made of greed
       Am
This is my kingdom come
       F
This is my kingdom come

       C
When you feel my heat
       G
Look into my eyes
       Am
It's where my demons hide
       F
It's where my demons hide
       C
Don't get to close
       G
It's dark inside
       Am
It's where my demons hide
       F
It's where my demons hide

       C
they say its what you make
       G
i say its up to fate
       Am
its woven in my soul
       F
i need to let you Go

       C
your eyes they shine so bright
       G
i want to save that life
       Am
i cant escape this now
       F
unless you show me how

       C
When you feel my heat
       G
Look into my eyes
       Am
It's where my demons hide
       F
It's where my demons hide
       C
Don't get to close
       G
It's dark inside
       Am
It's where my demons hide
       F
It's where my demons hide
